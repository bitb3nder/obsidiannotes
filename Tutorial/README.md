### Welcome to Obsidian

This is a pentester's assistant vault. [[Why obsidian]] If you're not familiar with markdown (or specifically obsidian markdown), this is going to feel really weird. [[Obsidian Usage|Here]] is a quick guide on some tips/tricks to get you started. Beyond general obsidian usage, this vault has been curated to ease usage and maximize relationships between notes through an automated folder placement/tagging/linking process that is handled entirely via scripts. When you're ready, lets start playing around with the vault and [[Tutorial Levels|make some changes]]. 
### Getting Up and Running

This depends on where the vault is being hosted. Assuming that it is still in Bitbucket you can clone the repo in any local directory you want:
```
git clone git@github.com:ovobenjamin/obsidian-pentest-notes.git
```

From there you just need to load the vault into the application. 
![[README-20240202091400344.webp|300]]

Honestly, if you're reading this though you have probably already figured this out.
