### 👾 Hello, there!

Why would I:
##### Use this Notebook?
To get good at taking notes. No reason to remember every little command, obsidian is your new second brain. 

##### Use Obsidian in general?
Obsidian is freeware, much like other services like Notion. However, the backend to Obsidian is completely open (raw folders and markdown files). The only reason Obsidian knows to parse this as an Obsidian vault is because of the `.obsidian/` folder in the vault root. This allows for a lot of customization, open-source plugins, and data modification outside of the application. 

> [!warning] OPSEC Consideration 
> One drawback to everything is stored in plain markdown, even code snippets, is that everything is stored in plain markdown, even code snippets. Obviously Obsidian has code execution potential, so the vault should never be placed in an exclude folder or equivalent.
##### Layout
This notebook is TTP focused, so the majority of the notes will stem from TTPs. As you fill out notes on TTPs (what to look for, caveats, commands to exploit) you will be presented with the opportunity to link tools and documentation as relevant to the TTP. This way Obsidian will function as an operational database with all the knowledge required in one location. 

All done? Back to the [[README]].
