### 👾 Hello, there!

How do you use this thing. 
##### Obsidian Markdown 
This notebook is not 100% markdown, there are obsidian specific commands that are super useful and will save you a lot of time. 

`[[link]]` will make a link to a page. there is an autocomplete feature, its sweet. linking notes is super important, kind of the whole point.

**bold text** 
*italic text* 
`inline snippet`

```
code block
```

> [!info] Callout
> Can have both Header text and body test!

> [!bug]- Collapsable Callout
> With text inside!

| Table           | Info          |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| A really simple | table manager |
| much easy       | very wow      |

and obviously tags and headers are demonstrated pretty thoroughly, automation has been put in place to minimize how much of that you'll actually need to do. 
##### Images
Images are stored in the vault in slightly compressed format and then linked dynamically. I configured all images to redirect to an image folder and then hidden with the community plugin hider. They do exist in the folder structure tho, so offline viewing will still work! 
##### Metadata (Frontmatter)
when 
```
---
alias: []
---
```
is at the top of the file, obsidian will recognize this as metadata and render it as such. there is a ton of flexibility with what can be done here, especially since dataview can pull this data easily in queries!

Dataview is an example of one of the many [[Community Plugins|community plugins]]!
I'm tired of this, take me back to the [[README]]
