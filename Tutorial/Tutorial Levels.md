> [!example] Tasks
> - [ ] Create a new file from a template (place it in the root directory)
> - [ ] Create a new page using the page template automation. The location of the note will often determine the template applied to the new note by default. 
> - [ ] Create a new folder using the folder creation automation, this will automatically generate tagging and linking to ensure that subsequent notes are tagged automatically. 

> [!example] Scripts
> On the left side bar, there are several non-native icons that run vault organizing scripts. Using what we have created so far we are going to use them to fix some things. 
> - [ ] In the new note you created, update the note summary with the edit summary script titled "update note summary"
> - [ ] Use the tag for follow up feature to add the tag and a note. This change will be easily viewable in [[Home]] 
> - [ ] Using the "reorganize current note", move the note into the folder that you created in step 1.
